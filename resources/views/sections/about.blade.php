                <p class="art-text art-white">Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Christian Djeukeu,</p>
                <p class="art-text art-white">I am a Cameroonian software developer currently based in the UK. During my
                    time at university, I was always curious to solve real life problems through programming. In June
                    2021, I started an internship at Arrah Solution, where I was introduced to mobile and web
                    application development, which was the beginning of my journey in the tech industry. At Arrah
                    Solution, I quickly became interested in cloud computing technologies such as AWS. So, in my spare
                    time, I decided to learn more by attending online courses on AWS and Docker & Kubernetes.
                </p>
                <p class="art-text art-white">As a developer, I like to learn new technologies, regardless of the area
                    of expertise, be it mobile development, front-end development, back-end development, database
                    management, UI/UX design and cloud computing.In addition, I gain most of my experience and skills by
                    taking online courses, working on side projects, and even being a web developer instructor at
                    GetSmarter. I also like to try new tricks on my side projects.
                </p>
                <p class="art-text art-white">I have also faced many challenges during my career growth. Firstly, there
                    were environmental challenges such as poor lighting and unstable internet connection. Secondly, I
                    had no one to mentor or even guide me, but at least I have friends and colleagues with whom we share
                    ideas and learn from each other. I also had the internet to help me in my search.
                </p>
                <p class="art-text art-white">Accelerating to today, I have 2+ years of experience in defining
                    requirements, designing, implementing and deploying applications using various technologies.My
                    aim is to fine tune my skills and build amazing and high quality applications.
