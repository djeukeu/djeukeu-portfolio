                <p class="art-text art-white">I am meticulous, organised and a Certified AWS Developer with years of
                    experience in defining requirements, designing, implementing and deploying applications. Using the
                    tools and knowledge I have gained over the years as a developer, I oversee client projects from the
                    identification of project needs through to completion. As a developer, I have a wide range of skills
                    in mobile development, front-end development, back-end development, database management, UI/UX
                    design and cloud computing.</p>
